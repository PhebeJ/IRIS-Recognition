# Iris_Recognition
This procedure is based on Python 3.6.

To run the procedure, please first install the requirements mentioned in : pip install -r requirements.txt

Then, type: python IrisRecognition.py to run codes.
The result will be printed and save in directory.

The process:

	1. read all images of train and test
	
	2. for each image in image set:
			1) (optional) roughly detect pupil
			2) using hough transform to detect pupil and iris
			3) normalization and enhancement
			4) filter and extract
			5) add to train feature set or test feature set
	3. evaluation:
		1) evaluate recognition results:
			1) calculate the CRR with different metrics 'l1', 'l2' and 'cosine'
			2) re-calculate the CRR with different dimensionalities (20, 40, 60, 80, 100)
			3) save csv file (table3)
			4) draw fig and save png file (fig10)
			
		2) evaluate identification results:
			1) generating 5000 sampling set according to the paper
			2) calculate the FMR, FNMR for each threshold for each time.
			3) calculate the mean and internal of each threshold
			4) save csv & draw fig & save fig.
	

The limitations:

	1. This paper did not process the noises such like eyelid and eyelash, 
	which really limit the performance. To remove noises such like eyelid and eyelash, 
	we may apply canny edge detection and use Hough algorithm.
	
	2. This paper only use two channel of gabor filter, which can be thought as a small value. 
	So, adding more kernals is a good idea.

    According to the codes of skimage, I directly rewrote the function gabor_kernel.

    Parameters
    ----------
    frequency : float
        Spatial frequency of the harmonic function. Specified in pixels.
    theta : float, optional
        Orientation in radians. If 0, the harmonic is in the x-direction.
    sigma_x, sigma_y : float, optional
        Standard deviation in x- and y-directions. These directions apply to
        the kernel *before* rotation. If `theta = pi/2`, then the kernel is
        rotated 90 degrees so that `sigma_x` controls the *vertical* direction.
    n_stds : scalar, optional
        The linear size of the kernel is n_stds (3 by default) standard
        deviations
    offset : float, optional
        Phase offset of harmonic function in radians.
    Returns
    -------
    g : complex array
        Complex filter kernel.
